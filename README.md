# Pacman

Welcome to Pacman!

Here are some instructions for building and running the Pacman Solution:

1. Open a new command line terminal window and expand the window to be a decent size; the bigger the better!
    - this is because the game will not display properly if the window size is too small
2. cd into the PacmanGame directory and run "dotnet run" to start the game
3. Once running, do not resize the terminal window
